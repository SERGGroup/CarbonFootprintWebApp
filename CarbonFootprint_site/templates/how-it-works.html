    How it works - brief introduction to CarbonApp
  </h1>
  <span class="how-it-works-text01">
    <span class="how-it-works-text02">
      CarbonApp is a calculator that calculates the emissions of Carbon
      Dioxide equivalent ( because it also evaluates other substances'
      impact, like methane that contributes to global warming potential)
      related to the lifestyle of a single person.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text04" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text05">
      In fact it uses data about the lifestyle of the person that uses
      the calculator; the main fields that we used are: Diet, Transport,
      Home and Clothes.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text07" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text08">
      All the data that are used for this project are taken by
      literature and articles, and are all reported into an excel file
      that you can download at the end of the page.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text10" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text11">
      In each input box you have to insert the related data, if the
      answer is “0” you can choose to not insert anything.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text13" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text14">
      All the decimal numbers that you insert must use “,” and
      absolutely not “.” because it will not be evaluated by the program
      and it will return some errors.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text16" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text17">
      It’s also recommended to insert at least one input for each field,
      for the correct operation of the site.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text19" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text20">For the</span>
    <span class="how-it-works-text21">Diet</span>
    <span class="how-it-works-text22">
      part you have to insert data about a typical week, and what you
      eat in average quantities; the most impactful elements are the
      beef part, so pay more attention to these data in order to get
      more realistic results.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text24" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text25">For the</span>
    <span class="how-it-works-text26">Transport</span>
    <span class="how-it-works-text27">
      part, you have to similarly insert data about which method to move
      around in a typical week you use; there is also a part related to
      airplanes that needs data referred to a typical year, because we
      supposed that could be easier to insert such data.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text29" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text30">
      Obviously if you use a bicycle or you move by walk you can insert
      any data in the transport boxes, and you don’t need to insert how
      much kilometers you run by bicycle/walk because it not produce any
      emission (probably could be insert the production impact of the
      bicycle, but this element is negligible with bike sharing). Both
      walking and bicycling reduce your Footprint and improve your
      well-being.

    <span class="how-it-works-text33">For the</span>
    <span class="how-it-works-text34">House</span>
    <span class="how-it-works-text35">
      part, the first thing to insert is the number of family members,
      because it allows to distribute the impact of some part, like the
      impact of house heating or washing machine; the elements that are
      corrected with the number of family members are indicated into the
      information box near to the input box.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text37" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text38">For the</span>
    <span class="how-it-works-text39">Clothes</span>
    <span class="how-it-works-text40">
      part, you have to insert the number of clothes that you buy each
      year; all the data used for this part are affected by lack of
      knowledge because there is a very poor database about this field,
      in fact we used data from different countries and this makes the
      data not regional coerent.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text42" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text43">
      At the end of the input collection you can press the Calculate
      button in order to see your results.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text45" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text46">
      Different graphs are shown, in particular: there is a comparison
      of your impact in the four fields that we asked for data, and also
      a comparison of your global impact with respect to the per capita
      impact of different countries in the world.

    <br />
    <br class="how-it-works-text48" />
    <span class="how-it-works-text49">
      At the end of the results page there is a Download button that
      allows you to download an excel file that contains all the impacts
      for each element, and create different and more detailed graphs.
      Remember to activate the excel file in order to see the results.
